## About DC


The desk calculator (dc) is a reverse-Polish calculator with arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Originating from the efforts of [Lorinda Cherry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorinda_Cherry) and [Robert Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_(cryptographer)) at Bell Labs, it stands as one of the earliest Unix utilities, predating the development of the C programming language.

Some new commands on string have been added to enable code golfing: [bc-1.07-tal/README.md](bc-1.07-tal/README.md).
